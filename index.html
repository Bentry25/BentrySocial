          <p>I'm Ben, and this is my website.</p>
          <p>I've got a more "official" site at <a hre="bengentry.com">bengentry.com</a> 
            but this is where blogging, WIPs, and other messy stuff will live.</p>

            <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
              <p>I dabble in a lot of things, but my work lately has been in environmental policy and interactive media.</p>
              <p> Other interests include (but are not limited to): museums, music, sound design, and VJ-ing (using TouchDesigner).</p>
              <p> Some things I want to do more of: embroidery, 3D Art, writing and/or poetry. </p>
            <hr/>
          </section>
          <p>For now, this website will be relatively sparse. I may add some pages, but maybe it's worth keeping things simple. We'll see! </p> 
          <p>Feel free to reach out via the guestbook! I'm still working on personalizing it, but it should be functional now.</p>
