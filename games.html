          <h1>Games</h1>
          <p>I'm planning to use this space to share games that I've enjoyed, or general thoughts!</p>
          <hr/> 
          <p><i>Before that, allow me to indulge in some shameless self-promotion :3</i></p>
          <h3>Here's some games I've worked on!</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><a href= "https://store.steampowered.com/app/3683200/Anne__Marys_Hunt_for_Booty/">Anne and Mary's Hunt for Booty</a></li>

              <li><a href ="https://crab-milk.itch.io/the-wok-ing-dead"> The Wok-ing Dead</a></li>
                <ul>
                <li>A short time management + cooking sim game made for <a href="https://itch.io/jam/texas-game-jam-2025/rate/3919123" >Texas Game Jam 2025! </a></li>
                </ul>

              <ul>
                <li>Created for UT Austin's <i>"Games For Good"</i> course. <a href="https://www.bengentry.com/sound-design/games-for-good">My main page</a> has more info!</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
          <hr/> 
          <p>While I'm working on this page, here's some recommendations:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Outer Wilds</li>
                <ul>
                    <p>I have pestered multiple friends into playing this.<br>
                      If you can make it past the <a href="https://youtu.be/msABa06aiT0?si=tFsH0bvTV7HV_yXv"> initial learning curve,</a> it's absolutely worth it!</p>
                </ul>
              <li>Skin Deep</li>
                <ul>
                <li>If you're a fan of immersive sims, this is that but with a slapstick coat of paint and "Looney-Toons" gadgets</li>
                </ul>
              <li>Immersive Sims (genre)</li>
              <ul>
                <li><p>If you don't know what I mean by immersive sims: There's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immersive_sim#Lineage"> a whole family tree of games</a> descended 
                  from (or inspired by!) LookingGlass studios. I'm a huge fan of the genre as a whole, and I highly suggest trying them out! I started with Dishonored.</p>

                    Calvin's Father: 'Playing an immersive sim? I'll show you something interesting.' 
                    / 'All immersive sims actually fall into two categories: Deusex-likes and Thief clones. Gloomwood? Thief clone. Ctrl Alt Ego? Deusex-like'
                    Calvin: 'Yeah'
                    Calvin's Father: 'Dishonored? Thief clone. Weird West? Deusex-like. In spite of being created before it, system shock is actually a Deusex-like.'
                    Final frame is Calvin, sleepless and distraught.
